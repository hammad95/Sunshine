Sunshine
========

Sunshine is the companion Android app for the Udacity course [Developing Android Apps: Android Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853).

Sunshine is a weather app that fetches live weather data from the openweathermap API. The app stores the fetched data into an SQLite database. The data is then retrieved from the database to be displayed onto the UI using a Cursor Loader which performs queries on the underlying Content Provider.

The app features a beautiful and user-friendly UI. It has a nice adaptive display for both phones and tablets.

Furthermore, the app is capable of displaying notifications to the user upon updates from the server.
